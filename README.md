- This is app is designed for the future because people will have most of the activity on the internet and that is where to servie our costumers. 
- The app allows a user to login to the website and access their profile where their list of products for sale are shown. 
- The profile page includes seller information as well as the collection of items they have purchased previously. 
- The home page of the app illustrates a wide array of products, which are filterable by category type. 
- Clicking a product, users will see more detailed information and can add the product to their cart. When a user is ready to make a purchase, they can click the button to add to cart and it will go to customer's collection, so they can see what they have purchased.
